    <h1>Spycrab Gambling
        When using the taunt while holding the Disguise Kit, there is a chance to use the Spycrab taunt. Sometimes Spycrabs have competitions to see who can get the Spycrab taunt first.
        
        Spycrab Line
        When many Spycrabs groups together, they will form great lines and march to another part of the map. These migrations are quite dangerous, as a tryhard could come out at any moment and start firing at them.
        
        Dead Ringer Spycrab
        Theorized to be the rarest subspecies of spycrab. They act exactly like a normal spycrab but will fake their death with the dead ringer, allowing for escape and continuing to live on. Due to tryhard pyros finding their meat delicious, they have been hunted to near extinction. Only ancient/outdated archives have managed to let us know of this specimen's existence.Box spies
        Box spies are a subclass of the Spycrab. They will use the taunt Box Trot and slowly move around, stopping whenever someone turns their way. While Box spies have a community themselves, lesser developed box spies will usually use both spycrab and Box Trot together.

        Location's
        
        The Spycrabs, although quite rare, have been seen around every map but 2Fort is their most inhabited location. The Spycrabs go there despite the amount of friendly-hungry tryhards located there waiting for prey.</h1>
