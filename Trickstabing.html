When you are in range for a successful backstab, the Spy will ready his Knife for a stab with a reverse-grip stance. If the Spy doesn't have his Knife in a reverse-grip, you may perform a low-damage slash instead. Look for the change in grip before attempting a backstab if you're unsure if the backstab will actually register.
Although a backstab grip guarantees a backstab, many other pokes will register a backstab as well. As long as your stab connects with the enemy's rear-facing half, any swipe or poke should kill him.
The Knife does rather low damage when it's not a backstab. Only attack with it if you are certain it will backstab, or else you will deal minimal damage and give away your position.
The Saxxy does not have a backstab stance.
Compared to your other Melees, the stock Knife is the most reliable of them all. You are able to disguise at will, have no health downsides and does not need to be recharged.
In most scenarios, you should switch to the Revolver to fight enemies once you've been discovered. Even in close range, the Revolver is significantly more powerful than non-backstab Knife swipes.
Because a backstab is always a melee kill, enemies killed by a Knife backstab will always emit a blood-curdling scream upon death. It is important when killing an enemy that you have a plan to either run from or kill nearby foes as soon as you perform your first stab.
A quick stab with the Knife into the air is generally the fastest way to silently drop your disguise (the most silent way to do it is to disguise as a Spy of your own team, but it can be somewhat slower). This can be used to perform covert Capture Point captures.
If you encounter a Sniper with the Razorback, it is generally a good idea to shoot him with a Revolver, rather than trying to stab him.
If a Sniper equipping the Razorback is standing near a corner, it is much quieter to stab his Razorback, turn the corner, and cloak. When the Sniper either finishes Spy checking or doesn't react, backstab him. If he returns to a Resupply Cabinet, shoot him; even though it's louder, he will quickly catch on and possibly find you. Be wary that the Razorback replenishes itself after a period of time, so be quick.
Be aware that the Saxxy and the Spy-cicle leave very noticeable corpses, the former being made of shimmering Australium, the latter being an ice sculpture. They are very likely to reveal your presence.
In addition try to refrain from using the Sharp Dresser. It has its own unique backstab animation in the kill feed which will practically announce to the enemy team that you are using a stock Knife reskin. This could very well give away your playstyle and allow enemies to more easily predict how you will strike.
When discovered, an advanced technique to help fend off the pursuer is to run up a slope, jump over the head of the pursuer, do a 180 degree turn, crouch, and backstab him. This is commonly called the stair-stab. [1]
Due to the flashiness of the move and the general popularity and publicity of "trick stabs" and those who perform them, even inexperienced players will know better than to blindly pursue a Spy that's standing on the top of a set of stairs with his Knife out. Unless your prey is clearly fooled or desperate, mask your intent as much as possible via blind spots, and have an escape plan for if your enemy does not behave as you want them to. To make your attempt less obvious, do not face the enemy as if waiting for them when attempting a stairstab.

As manual disguises cost an entire cloak meter, utilize manual disguises only when either no enemies and/or a source of ammo are nearby (be aware that ammo cannot refill the cloak meter of the Dead Ringer).
Kills with Your Eternal Reward are truly silent; the victim will not scream and their bodies disappear upon death, whether they are backstabbed or not. Also, the enemy will not see their kill notification.
This weapon is extremely well-suited for taking out Sentry Guns when you already have a disguise. The Stab-n-Sap technique is made easier and kills in front of Sentry Guns are safer because the Sentry Gun will not detect you between disguises.
If you do not have a disguise and an Engineer is still guarding his Sentry Gun, you can uncloak behind the Engineer and use him as cover as the Sentry Gun turns around to face you. Stab him, and then sap his Sentry Gun.
Consider switching back to the original Knife when you need to quickly take out a sentry nest and don't have time to get a disguise. If you are quick, you should be able to sap his sentry after stabbing him, so the ability to disguise at will is helpful and the quick-disguise is unnecessary.
However, when taking out large sentry nests with multiple Engineers, stab-and-sapping will be suicidal, and if you sap first, the Engineers will Spy check and likely kill you before you can take out a significant number of their buildings. Instead, with Your Eternal Reward, once you have a disguise, which can be obtained from a player waiting to go through a teleporter, you can slowly whittle away at the Engineers until there are none left, and then sap all of the buildings. The Teleporters may be a priority so you are not interrupted when they respawn.
Your Eternal Reward is very good when dealing with a crowd of enemies. After backstabbing the enemy farthest back in the group, you are able to continue to push forward without raising suspicion from those around him. Continue stabbing until you kill all of the enemies or you need to escape.
Be aware that successful backstabs with Your Eternal Reward will not stop enemies capping a Control Point or pushing the Payload Cart. It will, however, slow them down until there are none left. It may be a better choice to shoot enemies with the Revolver so that you can inflict damage while stopping the enemies from capturing.
When using Your Eternal Reward on Control Point maps, be wary when defending the final control point. Because the Eternal Reward disguises instantaneously, stabbing enemies capping your last point will not disrupt the cap (it will, however, slow the capping with one less person, or two if any of the following occurs; a Scout on point or if a Soldier or Demoman has the Pain Train equipped). This can allow for survivors to continue to cap while you frantically try to stab them. Pulling out your selected Revolver at this time to stall for friendly backup is usually the best response.
